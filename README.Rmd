# mrJ2R

The goal of mrJ2R is to implement the proposed estimator to evaluate the average treatment effect (ATE) under jump-to-reference (J2R). 

The file `sim_1time.R` 
gives a way to generate the simulated dataset using the function `sim_dat(n, k, alpha, gamma)`, where $n$ 

## Installation

You can install the development version of mrJ2R from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("siyi48/mrJ2R")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(mrJ2R)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
